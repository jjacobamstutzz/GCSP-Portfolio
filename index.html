            <p class="lead">Welcome to my Grand Challenges Scholars Program (GCSP) digital portfolio. This portfolio serves as a space to document and reflect on my academic journey, projects, and experiences as a computer science student at Arizona State University. It highlights my coursework, interdisciplinary learning, and personal growth throughout the GCSP, while showcasing how my interests and skills continue to evolve over time.</p>

            <p>My name is Jacob Amstutz, and I am majoring in Computer Science at Arizona State University. I am a participant in the Grand Challenges Scholars Program, with a thematic focus on Joy of Living, which aligns with my interest in creating technology that enhances everyday experiences and improves quality of life. I was drawn to computer science because I enjoy creating things and solving problems, and I have always been interested in computers and how they work at both a technical and conceptual level.</p>

            <p>A significant part of my GCSP experience has been my involvement in EPICS, where I work on the Tack Braille Display Project—a long-term, community-focused effort aimed at improving web accessibility for visually impaired users through intelligent braille hardware and software integration. This project has allowed me to apply computer science in a real-world, human-centered context while collaborating across disciplines and engaging with accessibility challenges that directly impact people’s daily lives.</p>

            <p>I am also a Barrett, The Honors College Fellow, which has further shaped my academic experience through an emphasis on interdisciplinary learning, research, and intellectual curiosity. This combination of honors education, hands-on project work, and GCSP involvement has motivated me to pursue opportunities that blend creativity, technical problem-solving, and social impact.</p>

            <p>This portfolio introduces both who I am and what I aim to accomplish through my academic and professional experiences. Within these pages, you will find reflections on courses such as FSE 150, documentation of projects and research, and evidence of my engagement across the GCSP competency areas. As I continue my journey at ASU and beyond, this portfolio will grow to represent my developing skills, interests, and commitment to using computer science to positively impact the lives of others.</p>
