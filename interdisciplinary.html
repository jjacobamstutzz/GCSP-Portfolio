      <h2>Perspectives on Grand Challenges for Engineering</h2>
    <p>My experience in FSE 150 has taught me that engineering is more than just solving problems. It is a field that incorporates people, systems, and global impact. Through Sustainability, Health, Security, and Joy of living, I have developed an understanding of how engineering connects to real world challenges. Each of these themes has taught me something different but together they emphasize responsibility, collaboration, and purpose driven design.</p>

        <p>The Sustainability theme changed how I think about the future of technology. Listening to Dr. Nicholas Rolston’s talk titled “The Next Generation of Renewable Energy Devices,” I learned that new materials called perovskites can revolutionize solar technology through flexible and lightweight designs. I had mainly thought of sustainability as something that engineering wouldn’t have much of an impact on. I had thought of smaller ideas like recycling or environmental protection. I now see it applies to processes like manufacturing, scalability, and supply chains. In class the circular design framework showed how systems can minimize waste and reuse materials. I realized that I can use those ideas in my work as a computer science major by keeping the AI models as compact as possible in order to use as little resources as possible. This was the first time I saw my technical interests tied to environmental responsibility.</p>

        <p>The Health theme helped me understand the human side of engineering. Dr. Randy Nudo’s talk, “Re-Engineering Damaged Brains,” showed how brain machine interfaces help people regain movement after injury. I was fascinated to learn that these devices don’t just replace damaged functions, they rewire the brain through neuroplasticity. Our class then had a debate on CRISPR gene editing and determined whether or not human life should be altered using technology. These experiences showed me that engineering must be combined with ethics to be truly effective. This resonates with my work in AI where many questions about bias, autonomy, and responsibility come up constantly. This theme strengthens my belief that empathy and ethics are essential components of innovation.</p>

        <p>The Security theme revealed how fragile and interconnected our systems are. One example of this was the NeuralGrid cyber disaster simulation we had in class. I was the President of the United States and coordinated with agencies like FEMA for disaster relief and security management. The simulation forced me to think about how each action has unintended consequences. This taught me that effective leadership and thoughtful decisions are critical to security just as much as technology is. We had to maintain a strong relationship with the press as well as with agencies to ensure effective relief. This showed me that the main challenge in security wasn’t technical at all, it was ensuring trust and maintaining clarity under pressure. This helped me reshape my understanding of cybersecurity, and security in general, and showed me that communication alongside foresight is as vital as technical defense systems.</p>

        <p>The Joy of Living theme helped tie everything together and made me remember why I wanted to be an engineer in the first place, to make life better and spark curiosity. Dr. Lindy Elkins-Tanton’s talk on the Psyche Mission illustrated that point perfectly. It was a mission driven by curiosity, teamwork, and inclusion to reach an asteroid for knowledge rather than profit. I also created a “Joyful College Experience” by creating a tailored classroom for students. It had immersive lighting, adaptive smart-screens, and VR pods and it was designed for well-being not just convenience. This helped me understand that joy is a great engineering outcome when systems are built with empathy and intention.</p>

        <p>FSE 150 has been one of the most valuable introductions to what it means to be an engineer. Before this course, I saw engineering as a wholly technical idea. I now see it as a human centered discipline that bridges sustainability, ethics, security, and joy all in one. I enjoyed the variety that the course brought, using experiences like faculty talks, group activities and discussions, and design challenges. All of these together taught me that innovation in engineering is most effective when it is connected to a broader idea.</p>

        <p>In the future, I plan to use these ideas that I have learned in this class in my career. I want to create systems that aren’t just about useability, I also want to incorporate designs that are ethical and human centered as well. Using the framework that this class has taught me, I hope to remember that engineering is as much about intention and impact as it is about utilizing empathy and purpose in designs.</p>
