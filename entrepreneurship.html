        <h3>Description / Summary of the Course Experience</h3>
        <p>FSE 301: Entrepreneurship is a business-focused course centered on the process of creating a product or
          service from the ground up and pitching it to an audience. Throughout the semester, the course emphasized
          identifying real consumer problems, validating ideas through customer discovery, and iterating based on
          feedback. Rather than starting with a finished product, the course pushed us to begin with user needs, test
          assumptions, and refine our ideas continuously.</p>

        <p>As part of this course, I created AutoSphere, a car-focused social platform designed to bring automotive
          enthusiasts together. The app concept revolved around a central feed where users could showcase their cars,
          interact with others who share similar interests, and organize or discover local car meets. Over the semester,
          I worked through the full entrepreneurial process: defining the problem, developing the concept, collecting
          consumer feedback and testimonials, refining the value proposition, and ultimately pitching the product. This
          experience gave me hands-on exposure to both the creative and practical sides of entrepreneurship, from idea
          validation to public presentation.</p>

        <h3>Connection to GCSP Theme: Joy of Living</h3>
        <p>My GCSP theme is Joy of Living, which focuses on improving quality of life and encouraging meaningful
          engagement with everyday interests. While AutoSphere is not essential technology, it directly contributes to
          joy of living by fostering community, connection, and shared passion. Cars are more than just transportation
          for many people—they are a hobby, a creative outlet, and a way to connect with others.</p>

        <p>AutoSphere was designed to enhance that experience by making it easier for people to meet others who share
          their interests, showcase their creativity, and participate in real-world events like car meets. By
          encouraging social interaction and community building around something people genuinely enjoy, the project
          aligns well with the Joy of Living theme and highlights how technology can enhance leisure, identity, and
          social connection.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on Value to My GCSP Work and Career Goals</h3>
        <p>This course was valuable because it taught me how to bring a project to fruition and confidently communicate
          its value to others. One of the most important skills I gained was learning how to talk to consumers before
          committing fully to an idea. Instead of diving straight into building something, I learned how to gather
          feedback early, understand what users actually want, and shape the product around real needs rather than
          assumptions.</p>

        <p>FSE 301 also helped me realize that I can combine my personal interests with my professional goals.
          AutoSphere was a project I genuinely enjoyed working on, yet it still allowed me to build skills that are
          directly relevant to my career in computer science and technology. From a professional standpoint, the course
          strengthened my ability to pitch ideas, explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences, and demonstrate
          real project growth—skills that are valuable in both startup and industry environments. Overall, this
          experience reinforced my confidence in creating meaningful, interest-driven projects while continuing to grow
          as an engineer and future professional.</p>
