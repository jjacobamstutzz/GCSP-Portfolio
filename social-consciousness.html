      <h2>EPICS (FSE 404) – Bridge2Africa / Tack Braille Display</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p style="color:var(--muted); margin-bottom:1rem; font-weight:500;">Fall 2024 – Spring 2025</p>

        <p>During the Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semesters of my sophomore year, I participated in EPICS (FSE 404) as a
          member of the Bridge2Africa Braille Display project, which later evolved into what is now known as the Tack
          Braille Display. These were my first two semesters in EPICS, and they marked my first long-term,
          community-centered engineering experience. This project significantly shaped how I understand the social
          responsibility of technology.</p>

        <p>The goal of the project was to improve digital accessibility for visually impaired users by developing a more
          affordable and intelligent braille display system. Over the course of these two semesters, our team developed
          and iterated on multiple hardware and software prototypes. On the hardware side, we partnered with Tetragon,
          an Austrian company specializing in braille display technology. Through this collaboration, we used Tetragon’s
          hardware as a foundation while focusing on building complementary software solutions. In return, we
          contributed software development and innovation designed to enhance the functionality and long-term
          accessibility impact of their devices. This partnership combined industry-level hardware expertise with
          student-driven software development and created a mutually beneficial relationship centered around improving
          accessibility.</p>

        <p>On the software side, we explored ways to improve how visually impaired users navigate and interpret web
          content, laying the groundwork for more intelligent content parsing and assistive browsing capabilities.
          Throughout the process, we emphasized human-centered design. Rather than building technology in isolation, we
          considered how real users would interact with the system and what barriers they face in digital environments.
        </p>

        <p>Beyond technical development, the project expanded into entrepreneurship and public engagement. During this
          period, we formally established an LLC under the name Tack Braille Display, reflecting our intention to
          continue developing the project beyond the classroom. We also presented our work at the CSUN Assistive
          Technology Conference, one of the largest global conferences focused on accessibility and assistive
          technology. Presenting at CSUN allowed us to share our findings, receive feedback from industry professionals
          and accessibility advocates, and better understand the broader landscape of assistive technology innovation.
        </p>

        <h3>Connection to Joy of Living</h3>
        <p>This experience directly connects to my GCSP theme of Joy of Living, which emphasizes improving quality of
          life through thoughtful and impactful innovation. Technology shapes nearly every aspect of modern life, and
          when digital systems are inaccessible, they limit independence, education, and opportunity. Through the Tack
          Braille project, I began to understand how inclusive engineering can restore autonomy and create more
          equitable digital experiences. Designing tools that remove barriers and empower users aligns strongly with my
          goal of using computer science to enhance everyday life. Accessibility is not simply a feature but a
          fundamental component of technology that truly improves well-being.</p>

        <p>These two semesters were foundational in shaping my academic direction and perspective as a computer
          scientist. They reinforced the idea that technical skills carry ethical responsibility and that engineering
          decisions have real human consequences. Through collaboration with Tetragon and engagement with the
          accessibility community, I learned that socially conscious innovation requires empathy, partnership, and
          long-term commitment. This experience strengthened my commitment to building technology that expands access,
          promotes independence, and positively impacts the lives of others.</p>
